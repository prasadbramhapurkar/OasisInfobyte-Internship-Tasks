            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>Vikram Sarabhai the doyen of science, astronomy and founding father of space research in India needs no introduction.  (12 August 1919- 30 December 1971) it is incumbent upon a grateful nation to pay their respects to the great son of India who laid the foundation for India to build its position of prestige and pride in world in the field of space research and nuclear science. It can be truly said his vision made it possible for us to literally reach the stars.

                He established the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in 1947 which was the nursery for space programme in India. The PRL had a modest beginning at his residence, the “RETREAT”, with research on cosmic rays. He was the founder of the hallowed Indian Space Research Organisation, ISRO, which has today grown from strength to strength with space orbiters reaching the Mars and Moon.
                Sarabhai started a project for the fabrication and launch of an Indian satellite. As a result, the first Indian satellite, Aryabhatta, was put in orbit in 1975 from a Russian cosmodrome.

                He studied at the Cambridge and later during World War II he came to India he joined the Department of Physics at the IISC Bangalore. His doctoral advisor was the great physicist, CV Raman. The IISC Bangalore then had  the legendary giants Vikram Sarabhai, Homi Bhabha and CV Raman all at the same time in its campus.</p>
